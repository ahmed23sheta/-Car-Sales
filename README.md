Headline: Driving Decisions with Data: My New Car Sales Dashboard 🚗📊

I’m excited to share a project where I turned raw sales data into an interactive visual story! This dashboard helps track performance and uncover trends at a glance.

1️⃣ The Problem 🔍 Tracking yearly and monthly sales across different regions and car models can be overwhelming. The goal was to simplify this complexity to see what’s actually driving the business.


2️⃣ Data Modeling & Calendar Logic 📅 : To ensure the analysis is accurate, I performed Data Modeling by:

Creating a Custom Calendar Table: I built a dedicated Date Table from scratch.

Establishing Relationships: I linked this table to the original sales data.

Why it matters? This allows for "Time Intelligence," making it easy to compare sales across different years, quarters, and months without any gaps in the timeline.

3️⃣ My Approach & Tools 🛠️ I used Power BI to create a dynamic experience :

Time-Series Analysis: Comparing Year-to-Date (YTD) vs. Month-to-Date (MTD) performance.

Geographical Mapping: Using Bing Maps to pinpoint high-performing regions.

Segmenting: Breaking down data by Body Style, Color, and Manufacturer.


4️⃣ Key Results 🏆

Total Sales (YTD): Reached a massive $371.2 Million.
Volume: Over 13,000 cars sold so far this year.
Growth: A strong 24.6% increase in units sold this month.
Top Sellers: Chevrolet, Ford, and Dodge are leading the pack.


5️⃣ Challenges & Lessons 💡

Data Accuracy: Handling a wide range of prices—from $12,000 to $82,000—required careful averaging.

Inventory Insight: I learned that sales aren't just about price; factors like "Engine Type" and "Color" play a huge role.


Data is more than just numbers; it’s the roadmap to better business moves! 🗺️
